# Data Bootcamp Project
This project was completed by Jassica Bouvier, Yasemin Esmen, and Sarah Hansen in partial fulfilment of COURSE NUMBER, Data Bootcamp MBA, Fall 2018. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project.

In particular, we have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And we understand that:

Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden. We acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

Kickstarter is a global crowdfunding platform founded in 2009. The company's stated mission is to "help bring creative projects to life". To date, Kickstarter has reportedly received more than $4 billion in pledges from 15.5 million backers to fund 257,000 creative projects, such as films, music, stage shows, comics, journalism, video games, technology and food-related projects.The purpose of this analysis is quite simply to learn more about Kickstarter. We will explore questions such as:

What is Kickstarter primarily used for?
What projects are succesful on the platform?
What is the average amount of money raised on the platform?
